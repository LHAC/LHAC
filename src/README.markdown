Prior to study at Lehigh, I earned my undergraduate degree in [Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/) from [Chu KoChen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/en-US/Introduction) in [Zhejiang University](http://goo.gl/u01q4Q), Hangzhou, China. During summer I worked at [industrial research labs](http://goo.gl/hphZnl) on projects in different fields such as machine learning, hierarchical classifications, time series forecasting, traffic control, etc.
